Seeding Models from a CSV file with Eloquent

Hi,
I'm new to laravel, so warning in advance that this might be a no-brainer.

I'm trying to seed a couple of Models with a CSV file. The file contans a list of names and locations of stores. Let's say it looks like this:

StoreName, City, State
store1, Philadelphia, PA
store2, Philadelphia, PA
store3, Altoona, PA
store4, Portland, OR
store5, Portland, OR

At the end, the result will be a City Model and a State Model. City would have columns for the name of the city, state, and total stores in that city:

id, name, state, total
1, Philadelphia, PA, 2
2, Altoona, PA, 1
3, Portland, OR, 2

And the State Model will have columns for name, and total stores in that state:

id, name, total
1, PA, 3
2, OR, 2

I then have a hasMany relation within the State Model:

class State extends Model
{
    public function cities()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(City::class, 'state', 'name');
    }
}

This relationship defines the 'state' column from the State Model as the foreign key, and the 'name' column from City as the local key.

I am wondering if this relationship could be better. Is there a way that I could build the City Model with an attribute of 'state_id', and then have that match the State Model's 'id' attribute? Would this make for a performance increase for when I call App\State::find(#)->cities?

Or, is there anything else I need to do to define 'state' as the foreign key for the State Model?

Thanks,
